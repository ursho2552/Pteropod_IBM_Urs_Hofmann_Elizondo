\begin{itemize}
    \item Habitat compression due to long term increase in acidification and shoaling of omega aragonite undersaturation horizon
    \item Main process leading to increased exposure is likely DVM (but some studies have suggested "active avoidance"
    \item Juvenile stage as the most susceptible stage (as expected by literature (maybe...))
    \item Difference between on-shore and off-shore pteropods
    \item Timing of largest exposure and the implications (possible shifts in the abundance peaks and the implication for higher trophic levels (fish, sea angels))?
\end{itemize}
