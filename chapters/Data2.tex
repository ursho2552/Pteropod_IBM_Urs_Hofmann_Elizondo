            \item Description of dissolution and repair functions, and pteropod weight changes
            \item Problems with the model (e.g. drift from coast, re-seeding approaches, 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Description of model tuning to the timing of abundance peaks as done for other IBMs (e.g. Miller et al. 2002), and vertical distribution
    \item Description of ROMS hindcast simulation and using the CalCS as a case study

    \item Case study of the effect of acidification on shelled pteropods.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Description of approach to separate between the effect of DVM, and life-stages in relation to acidification (i.e. advection-only model, no-DVM model, no-life-stages model, and full model)
        
        \item Description of exposure metrics (e.g. average shell size, CaCO$_3$ content, timing of abundance peaks individuals reaching maturity, deviation from optimal growth function, amount of dissolved CaCO$_3$)
