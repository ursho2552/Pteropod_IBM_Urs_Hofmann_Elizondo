\section{Pteropod-IBM comparison to abundance data and vertical distribution, and idealized growth function}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show the "no-response" model, and how it compares to MAREDAT abundance data.
    \item How does the average vertical distribution in the model compare  with Bednarsek and Ohman, (2015) data?
    \item Comparison to idealized course of shell size change presented in Wang et al. (2017)
\end{itemize}
\section{Case study CalCS: Exposure to acidification}
